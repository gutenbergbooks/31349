	<p>It is not always easy to laugh at Satan, or take pleasure in his antics. But
       when the Prince of Darkness goes on a vacation or holds a mirror up to human
       nature at its most Luciferian chuckles are certain to arise and follow one another
       in hilarious profusion. Here is a yarn contrived by a craftsman with ironic lightning
       bolts at his fingertips, as mordantly compelling as it is jovial and Jovian.
       If you liked <cite>SATAN ON HOLIDAY</cite>, and were hoping for a sequel you can now
       rejoice in full measure, for Ralph Bennitt has provided that longed-for delight.</p>

	<h1>SATAN
	AND
	THE
	COMRADES</h1>
	<p id="author">by … Ralph Bennitt</p>
	<p id="prolog">Lucifer wasn’t sure that just
    the right improvements had been
    made in Hell. So he used a dash
    of sulfur with Satanic skill.</p>
</div>





<div id="story">
	<p class="first_paragraph"><span class="first_word">Nick</span> felt almost good-humoredly
	buoyant after his year’s holiday
	as a college boy. About a second
	after leaving Earth he slowed his
	traveling speed down to the medium
	velocity of light by shifting
	from fifth dimension to fourth.
	Though still a million miles above
	the wastes of Chaos and twice that
	distance from the gates of Hell,
	his X-ray eyes were quick to discern
	a difference in the road far below
	him.</p>

	<p>Sin and Death had built that
	broad highway eons before. On
	leaving Hell, presumedly forever
	to carry on their work among men,
	they had done a mighty good job
	of the original construction. But
	time had worked its ravages with
	the primrose-lined path, and it was
	not surprising that on starting his
	sabbatical leave, Nick had ordered
	his chief engineer to repair the
	road as a first step in his plan to
	modernize Hell.</p>

	<p>Apparently, old Mulciber had
	done a bang-up job, and Nick
	roared in laughter at evidences of
	the engineer’s genius and those of
	<a class="pagenum" id="page114" title="114"> </a>wily Belial, the handsome court
	wag. The Propaganda Chief had
	added advertising at numerous new
	roadhouses along the way, and
	unwary shades traveling hellward
	gazed at beautiful scenes of lush
	vegetation instead of a dreary expanse
	like the Texas Panhandle.
	This “devilish cantraip sleight”
	also changed the raw Chaos climate
	to a steady 72°F and gave off a
	balmy fragrance of fruits and flowers.</p>

	<p>Ten thousand drachmas, a fictitious
	unit of currency established
	by foxy old Mammon, was the flat
	fee for use of the road. Blissfully
	unaware of this “Transportation
	Charge,” or how it would be paid,
	numerous phantom pilgrims were
	sliding down the steeper hills—and
	having a swell time. Their
	shouts of glee reached Nick’s
	largish ears despite the lack of air
	as mortals know it. Clever old
	Mulcie had installed freezing
	plants here and there to surface
	the road with glare ice.</p>

	<p>Nick poised above a party of
	phantom men and girls sliding
	downhill on their <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">derrieres</em> and
	ending in a heap at the bottom. A
	nice change from traveling under
	their own power. Their maximum
	speed while swift and incomprehensible
	to mortals, seemed relatively
	slow to one of Hell’s old
	timers. Only Nick and his best
	scout, Cletus, could move at
	thought speed—“Click-Click
	Transportation.”</p>

	<p>Drifting on, a pleased smile on
	his red, bony face, Nick paused
	several times to read Belial’s welcomings.</p>

	<p>“Die and see the original Naples
	in all its natural beauty,” said one
	sign. “Try our hot sulphur springs
	and become a new soul.” Gayest
	pleasures were promised to all and
	golfers had special attention. “Register
	with the pro at your favorite
	golf club so you can qualify. No
	charge for pro’s services who’ll
	teach you to break 80. Free lunch
	and drinks at all Nineteenth
	Holes.”</p>

	<p>No fool shade would wonder
	what he’d qualify for, nor suspect
	he’d have to shovel eighty million
	tons of coal and ashes before his
	handicap would be lowered enough
	to earn him a set of golf clubs or
	that the free lunch and drinks were
	chunks of brimstone, the sulphurous
	air and Styx River water which
	is always just below boiling point
	at 3,000°F.</p>

	<p>Hell’s thousand of new golf
	courses, gambling joints and bars
	would be available only after
	downtrodden souls had worked a
	millennia or two at common labor
	jobs. A shady deal, indeed, but
	all a part of Nick’s master plan
	to get him and his legions back to
	Heaven.</p>

	<p>By modernizing Hades he hoped
	to annoy “The Big Boss Upstairs”
	while diverting the attention of
	those two vigilant celestial watchers,
	Michael and Raphael, from the
	main idea. In a series of bold
	moves, known only to Nick and
	<a class="pagenum" id="page115" title="115"> </a>his Board or Inner Council, mankind
	would be wiped off the earth—and
	thus bring The BBU to
	time. Or so Nick hoped.</p>

	<p>As a first step, he had spent a
	year as Pudzy, a college boy, studying
	electronics and modern skills
	of all kinds. He had enjoyed the
	holiday on Earth though it irked
	him to recall that he’d been obliged
	to do good here and there. The
	thought of these satanic lapses
	caused him to frown, but his jolly
	mood returned when he saw the
	familiar gates of Hell wide open
	in obedience to his whistle.</p>

	<p>The whistle’s high frequency
	waves also awakened Cerberus, the
	three-headed watch dog, besides
	actuating “The Dingus.” This
	electronic device Nick had stolen
	to operate the three ponderous
	triple-fold gates of adamantine,
	brass and iron.</p>

	<p>He slowed to supersonic speed,
	brought back his great red wings
	and made a neat three-point landing
	without injuring the needle-sharp
	dart at the end of his long,
	black tail. Still feeling jovial, he
	kicked all three of Cerberus’s
	heads, then zoomed down through
	the tunnel to the north bank of
	the River Styx.</p>

	<p>There he halted to view the ten-lane
	suspension bridge Mulciber
	had thrown across the steamy black
	water. Nick was wondering how
	the old genius had accomplished
	such a feat when a thick black wall
	dropped across the bridgehead.</p>

	<p>“Cost you five thousand rubles
	to cross, mister,” Charon called in
	a thick voice.</p>

	<p>The old riverman who had ferried
	new shades across the earth-hell
	boundary for eons of time,
	had just returned after a year’s
	vacation in Moscow.</p>

	<p>He hid a bottle under his brimstone
	bench, then straightened a
	gaudy red tie as he weaved forward.
	A changed devil, Charon.
	His year in Redland had done
	more than put him into a natty
	summer suit. Although not very
	bright, he had unusual powers of
	observation. He liked to ape the
	odd speech of his customers, especially
	American prospectors. These
	truculent but harmless old timers
	worked at odd jobs around the
	nearby palace grounds, and in the
	ferryman they found a kindred
	spirit.</p>

	<p>Nick eyed the loyal old fellow’s
	red tie with amazement. “What,
	for St. Pete’s sake, are you drinking,
	Char?”</p>

	<p>“Vodka,” Charon gasped. Recognizing
	the stern voice, he tried
	to focus his bleary eyes. “’Scuse it,
	Your Majesty. I’ve come a long
	way and alone. Your substitute,
	Pudzy, gimme a bottle ’fore he
	returned to Ameriky, and it’s durn
	cold up there in Musk-Cow, and
	so I took a few nips, and I felt so
	goldurned glad to git back I polished
	off what was left, so I didn’t
	recognize Your Majesty when you
	came zoomin’ along, and if you’ll
	sort of <span class="keep_together">overlook—”</span></p>

	<p>Nick patted the frightened old
	<a class="pagenum" id="page116" title="116"> </a>fellow’s scrawny shoulder. “Better
	check in and sleep it off, Char.”</p>

	<p>“Gosh, stoppin’ <em>you!</em>”</p>

	<p>“You let everybody in till I tell
	you different. Forget the toll charge
	too, you old conniver.”</p>

	<p>“Yeah, and look!” Chortling
	with glee, Charon tottered back to
	his station and put one hand across
	the beam of a photo-electric eye.
	The ponderous gate slid silently
	upward. “It weighs fifteen hundred
	tons, Mulcie says, and I don’t even
	push a button.”</p>

	<p>“You still smell like a Communist,
	Char,” Nick said, sniffing
	the good sulphurous air. “How
	come you’re on the job as bridgekeeper
	if you’ve just returned from
	Moscow?”</p>

	<p>“Orders from Beelzebub, and
	it’s nigh a half hour by now since
	this fella came across the bridge.
	I’m sauntering home, friends with
	everybody, I <span class="keep_together">am—”</span></p>

	<p>“What fellow?”</p>

	<p>Charon scratched his grisly
	thatch. “Come to think of it, I
	never see ’im afore this. I’m standing
	back there, looking down at
	my old skiff and wondering about
	my job, when this fella comes up.
	‘This is for you, Charon,’ he says,
	and held out your official incombusterible
	letterhead with the cross-bones
	and dripping <span class="keep_together">blood—”</span></p>

	<p>“Yeah, yeah. What does this
	stranger look like? What’s his
	name? Who signed the paper?”</p>

	<p>“Beelzebub signed it. I guess I
	know the John Henry of your
	Number Two devil even if I am a
	dumb ferryman.” Perhaps sensing
	he had blundered, Charon almost
	wept. “This paper appoints me
	head bridge-tender from now to
	the <em>end</em> of eternity, and, bein’
	worried about my job, I hopped
	right to it. You’re the <span class="keep_together">first—”</span></p>

	<p>“Which way did he go? What’s
	he look like?”</p>

	<p>Charon almost said “Thataway,”
	as he shook his head and pointed
	a trembling finger to the distant
	shore. “Lemme see. He wore neat
	clothes about like mine, and he
	zoomed off like the upper crust
	shades do when in a hurry—which
	ain’t often. He has mean little
	eyes, sort of pale blue, is built wide
	and short, and talks American good
	as I do. Now’t I think of it, he
	had an impederiment in his speech,
	and he smelt like a bed of sweet
	peas.”</p>

	<p>“Very good, indeed.” Scanning
	the paper, Nick smiled as he recognized
	a forgery of the Beelzebub
	signature. He drew out his pen
	which writes under fire as well as
	water, and scribbled “Nick,” then
	put the document into the eager
	hands. “This gives you the job
	forever—or till I revoke the appointment.”</p>

	<p>“Boydy-dumb-deals!” Charon
	shouted. “Boss, you oughta hear
	about my adventures in Redland.
	I had a real gabfest with the new
	Premier, Andrei Broncov, and his
	Minister of Culture, Vichy Volonsky.”</p>

	<p>Nick grinned sardonically. “I
	heard a little about the most recent
	<a class="pagenum" id="page117" title="117"> </a>changes in the Kremlin. Are
	my old sidekicks well? And are
	they having any particular trouble
	since liquidating the old gang?”</p>

	<p>“How come you call that fat
	crumb, Broncov, your sidekick?”
	Charon frowned, trying to collect
	his wits in the dread presence. “He
	didn’t ask about you. He took me
	for an illegitimate son of Joe
	Stalin’s, so how would he know
	you and I are pals? I bought this
	red tie and hired a sleeping dictionary
	to catch onto the language
	better, <span class="keep_together">and—”</span></p>

	<p>“Your dictionary probably spilled
	things to the MVD.”</p>

	<p>“Not while my gold held out.
	Anyhow, those punks are way overrated.
	Tricky, maybe, and they lie
	good. They’d rather bump you off
	than eat breakfast.”</p>

	<p>“Purge is the word. The old
	comrades Broncov threw out a
	month ago now fully understand
	its meaning. How is the comrade?”</p>

	<p>“Gosh, boss, I’m sick of hearing
	that word. They say it just before
	they knife you. Broncov’s been
	busy, all right. Since taking over
	the Number One job he’s been
	sending a lot of his best friends
	down this way. To keep Joe Stalin
	company, he told me. He looks fat
	even if Bill Shakespeare says this
	new <span class="keep_together">lot—”</span></p>

	<p>“I suppose he and his pals plied
	you with liquor,” Nick said.</p>

	<p>“They tried to drink me under
	the table.” Charon cut a laugh in
	half. “Gosh, I durn near forgot.
	Y’know what the sidewinder,
	Bronco, babbled ’fore he passed
	out? Top drawer stuff. Only he
	and this Vichy Volonskyvich know
	about it. Seems Bronco learned,
	somehow, about your taking a vacation,
	so he’s been torturing a lot
	of his friends into confessing they
	plotted agin ’im. He promised them
	an easy death if they’d carry on
	down here. How you like that?”</p>

	<p>“The fools. What’s his plan?”</p>

	<p>“I ain’t sure I got it all as his
	tongue got thicker from the vodka.
	But I learned Hell’s full of comrades
	who’ve sworn to their god,
	Lee-Nine, they’ll toss you to the
	wolves. They aim to pull Joe Stalin
	off his clinker-picking job and
	make him secretary here.”</p>

	<p>“Go on,” Nick urged in ominous
	tones. “How?”</p>

	<p>“They’ve swiped some new secret
	weapon and figure to obliterate you
	and every devil in authority so
	things will be organized nice and
	cozy when they finally get here.
	<span class="keep_together">The Dumb—”</span></p>

	<p>“Good report, Char.” The new
	weapon did not bother Nick much,
	but from his profound studies of
	atom smashing he decided anything
	can happen these days even to a
	top devil. He continued briskly:
	“Hereafter, sniff all your customers
	and make sure they don’t <em>smell</em>
	like a Red. You know the aroma
	by now—sweet peas with an underlying
	stink—so keep your nose
	peeled. When you spot a comrade,
	radio-phone the guard. Those lads
	will know what to do you can bet
	your last ruble.”</p>

	<h2 id="chapter_2"><a class="pagenum" id="page118" title="118"> </a>II</h2>

	<p><span class="first_word">The rousing</span> welcome home
	Nick received as he climbed the
	hill to his great palace would have
	warmed his heart if he’d owned
	one.</p>

	<p>“Thanks, boys and girls,” he
	intoned in his best golden voice.
	“It’s swell to be back among you.
	I haven’t time for a speech now,
	but tune in to Channel Thirteen
	tomorrow evening for my fireside
	chat.”</p>

	<p>He wanted to take off for Moscow
	immediately, but decided to
	start the war by calling The Board.
	Also, the boys would be hurt if he
	didn’t inspect what they’d done
	during his absence. After a hasty,
	Russian-style dinner of caviar,
	cabbage and cold horse with a gold
	flagon of vodka, he ordered Azazel,
	Flag Bearer and Statistician Chief,
	to call a meeting in the throne
	room.</p>

	<p>Little Cletus waylaid his big
	boss. The scout among the celestials
	looked like a chubby cherub what
	with his dimpled cheeks and curly
	black hair, but he’d proved to be
	the trickiest imp south of the pearly
	gates. Knowing that Raphael had
	cajoled the little imp into revealing
	something of the improvements in
	Hades, Nick suspected treachery by
	one of his most trusted scouts.</p>

	<p>“I hear you’ve been seeing
	Raphael!” he barked.</p>

	<p>“Aw, I told ’im a pack of lies,”
	Cletus scoffed. “Maybe Rafe figured
	out something; he’s a smart
	apple. I told ’im everybody here is
	hot and unhappy like you ordered
	me to say if they ever caught me.
	I said our air-conditioning system
	goes haywire and that we were
	ripping out a thousand old boilers
	and coolers. Stuff like that.”</p>

	<p>“Don’t lie to me, you ornery
	little brat. Okay to anybody else
	but not to me. I happened to hear
	Rafe talking to Mike, and they’re
	wise to my plan of making Hell
	attractive.”</p>

	<p>“Well, hell,” Cletus protested,
	“they saw Mulcie’s gangs fixing
	the road. If Rafe and them extra-extrapopulated
	that dope to figure
	out the truth, why blame me?”</p>

	<p>“We’ll forget it,” Nick said,
	vastly relieved to believe his scout
	had not betrayed him. “I have a
	job for you. I’m going to Moscow
	and I want your help. Light out as
	soon as you can. Requisition as
	much gold as you can handle by
	the usual translation method, and
	include a sack of polished diamonds
	and rubies. I’ll tell Mammon it’s
	okay when I arrange for my own
	supply.”</p>

	<p>“Okay, boss. Where do we meet?
	And what am I supposed to look
	like, and do?”</p>

	<p>“Make yourself bellhop size and
	register at the Droshky Hotel as
	Prince Navi from Baghdad with
	fifty Persian oil wells to sell. Let
	’em see your gold and jewels. And,
	remember, you’ll account for any
	dough you toss away to women
	and bribes. Get going!”</p>

	<p>Nick could see into the <em>near</em>
	<a class="pagenum" id="page119" title="119"> </a>future, at least, and he chuckled
	after Cletus vanished through the
	wall. “The little devil doesn’t
	know what’s in store for him.”</p>

	<p>In the throne room, sage old
	Beelzebub sat at the right of His
	Majesty’s chair; huge Moloch with
	his evil grin and snaggle teeth, at
	the left. Tall, prissy Azazel, always
	acting important, planted Satan’s
	flag and then sat down at a table
	opposite wide-shouldered Mulciber
	and handsome Belial. Charter
	members all of the original organization
	booted out of Heaven some
	eighteen million years ago when
	Nick’s first but not last rebellion
	flopped.</p>

	<p>After the customary ritual of
	renewing their vow to get back to
	Heaven, the gang sat down. Nick
	rapped the arm of his throne and
	glared at Chemos, the lustful one.</p>

	<p>“Cheme,” he said, “if you will
	quit flirting with Astarte, The
	Board will take up business.”</p>

	<p>Belial snickered when the culprits’
	red faces grew even redder,
	and after a wink at the court wit,
	Nick went on: “I intend to take
	off for Moscow after a quick look
	about with Mulcie and Belial. Incidentally,
	my compliments on the
	good work you did on the road.”</p>

	<p>“Egad, boss,” Moloch complained,
	“why can’t you stay home more
	and line things up for us?”</p>

	<p>“Time <span class="keep_together">enough—”</span> Nick sniffed,
	scowled, then pointed toward a
	thick pillar near the rear of the
	big room. “I smell an interloper.
	Thammuz, Dagon, drag ’im up
	here! Beel, I fancy he’s the one
	who forged your signature.”</p>

	<p>Beelzebub rose in anger when
	a shadowy figure darted for the
	door. The intruder moved as fast
	as any wraith but the two former
	gods were too quick for him. A
	brief struggle, then they dragged
	the eavesdropper before the throne
	where they held him upside down.</p>

	<p>“It’s the Paperhanger!” Beelzebub
	roared.</p>

	<p>“I guessed that from Charon’s
	description,” Nick said calmly.
	“He’s siding with the Reds again—Smell
	him? Stand up, Adolf, and
	hear your sentence!”</p>

	<p>“I didn’t do a thing, Your
	Majesty,” Hitler began, but the
	hot, glowing eyes were too much
	to face. His knees buckled and he
	sank, groveling, on the floor. “Didn’t
	I send you millions of customers?”
	he wailed. “Haven’t I done
	a good job of sweeping out and
	collecting garbage? Have a heart,
	Nick. I came in here to sweep, and
	how would I know about this private
	conference?”</p>

	<p>“You talk about hearts?” Nick
	flared. “You hung around to listen.
	You forged Beelzebub’s signature
	on my official paper, then put
	Charon in charge of the bridge,
	thinking he’s too dumb to report
	any Commies coming here.”</p>

	<p>“I can <span class="keep_together">prove—”</span></p>

	<p>“You get the same chance at that
	which you gave people in Berlin.
	Down the chute with him, boys!”</p>

	<p>The chute, connecting with a
	main one leading down to the
	<a class="pagenum" id="page120" title="120"> </a>burning lake, has a flap which
	Belial gleefully lifted. Since shades
	have no mass worth mentioning,
	the long duct acts like a department
	store vacuum tube.</p>

	<p>“Oh, my beloved emperor, forgive
	me,” Adolf yelled as he felt
	the suction. “I only wanted to
	organize a counter-revolution
	against the Communists <span class="keep_together">and—”</span></p>

	<p>“Ratting on your pals again,
	eh?” Nick sneered. “You stay in
	the burning lake a thousand earth
	years. You’ll have plenty of time
	and company for your plotting.
	Let ’im rip!”</p>

	<p>“No! I’ll be <span class="keep_together">forgotten—”</span></p>

	<p>“No one remembers you now
	except as a dung heap.” Nick
	turned a thumb downward, and the
	screeching shade vanished.</p>

	<p>“Like a paper towel in a gale,”
	Belial said as he let the flap clang
	shut. “How’d that creep get a
	job where he could snoop?”</p>

	<p>“My fault,” Beelzebub admitted.
	“He’s a smooth talker. I saw him
	not long after you left, Your
	Majesty, when I went out to inspect
	the garbage incinerator. He had
	shaved off his dinky mustache and
	changed the color of his eyes, but
	I recognized him.”</p>

	<p>“It’s okay, Beel.” Nick patted
	the heavy shoulder of his top assistant.
	“The punk did us a left-handed
	favor in bringing things to a
	head.” He told of how Charon had
	discovered the Red plot, then outlined
	his general plan.</p>

	<p>“Those Commies can’t stand ridicule,”
	Nick summed up. “While
	I’m gone I want every Communist
	son tossed into the burning lake.
	Alarm all guards and tell them
	how to identify them—the fragrance
	of sweet peas with an underlying
	stink. No one in the USSR
	has used up a cake of soap in
	twenty years, and the perfume they
	add can’t quite cover the BO.”</p>

	<p>“Must be a lot of Commies
	here,” Mulciber commented. “How
	many guards have we, Azzy?”</p>

	<p>Azazel, Statistics Chief, glanced
	at a roll of incombustible microfilm,
	and cleared his throat. He
	liked being called upon, and since
	he had the history of every shade
	while on Earth, he was the second
	most feared devil in Hades.</p>

	<p>“After promoting the last batch
	who qualified for better jobs during
	the minimum millennium at common
	labor,” Azazel said, “and <span class="keep_together">adding—”</span></p>

	<p>“Never mind the commercial!”
	grouchy Moloch roared. “Boss, how
	do we know all our guards are to
	be trusted?”</p>

	<p>“We don’t,” Nick said. “When
	did we ever trust anybody? But
	our system of checkers, checkers
	checking the checkers, super-checkers
	on up to charter members,
	hasn’t failed yet.”</p>

	<p>“If His Eminence, The Corpse-Snatcher,
	is satisfied,” Azazel said,
	smoothing his sleek black hair, “I
	shall answer Prince Mulciber’s polite
	question. We now have on the
	guards’ roll exactly thirteen million
	four <span class="keep_together">hundred—”</span></p>

	<p>“That’s close enough.” Plainly
	<a class="pagenum" id="page121" title="121"> </a>pleased with his title, Moloch
	grinned at the big engineer. “Mulcie,
	why not build a chute straight
	up into Moscow? Save the boss
	trouble. He could take along a few
	gorillas and toss all those troublemaking
	stinkers straight into a hot
	bath.”</p>

	<p>Nick joined in the laughter.
	“Trouble with that, Molly, The
	BBU wouldn’t stand for it. Only
	Death can give the final sting, and
	even he has to wait for the call.
	Our game is to play it cagey, stick
	by the few rules The BBU laid
	down, and stay out of trouble.”</p>

	<p>“How do you aim to handle
	those fellas?” Belial asked.</p>

	<p>“Tell you after I do it.” Nick
	guessed the fun-loving Propaganda
	Chief wanted to go along, but
	decided Cletus would be a better
	assistant in a plan already formulated.
	A boon companion, Belial,
	for any nefarious project. True, he
	had the quickest wit of the lot,
	but had worked over-long in the
	advertising racket, and many of his
	schemes resembled those of a hen
	on a hot griddle.</p>

	<p>Nick turned to the secretary.
	“If you have all this down, Asta,
	I’ll consider a motion to adjourn.”</p>

	<h2 id="chapter_3">III</h2>

	<p><span class="first_word">It was an</span> hour short of midnight
	and snowing in Moscow
	when Nick landed in the printing
	room of Pravda, the official Red
	journal. As he had calculated,
	several sample newspapers had
	been run off.</p>

	<p>Vichy Volonsky, a short, roundheaded
	man, had held up the rest
	of the issue while he studied the
	content through his nose-glasses.
	Editor Blochensk and the mechanics
	anxiously awaited the great man’s
	verdict. An unfavorable one meant
	the concentration camp for everybody.
	As Minister of Culture, Volonsky
	previewed all news personally
	when not running errands for
	Andrei Broncov at a meeting of the
	Inner Council.</p>

	<p>The Number Two ranking man
	in the Kremlin clique frowned most
	frighteningly, then, moved by an
	odd compulsion, walked into a
	sound-insulated telephone room.
	He closed the door and stared at it
	stupidly while looking through the
	invisible Nick.</p>

	<p>“Why did I come in here?” he
	said. “There’s only the usual bilge
	in the sheet, nothing to telephone
	the fat slob about. Yet something
	made me.”</p>

	<p>“I did,” Nick said, suddenly
	visible. “When I finish, Pravda
	will never be the same again. Lie
	down, Vichy!”</p>

	<p>Volonsky opened his mouth, but
	Nick wiggled a finger, and no yell
	came out. In the wink of an eye,
	he squeezed out the Minister’s
	shade and took its place.</p>

	<p>“Pretty cramped and smelly
	quarters,” Nick told himself, “but
	do or die for good old Hades.”</p>

	<p>“What? Who are you?” Volonsky’s
	<a class="pagenum" id="page122" title="122"> </a>phantom teeth chattered.
	“You must be Nick, himself.”</p>

	<p>“Russia’s patron saint till you
	amateurs took over. I have business
	with your boss. I mean Andrei
	Broncov. Not that it matters, but
	who conceived the idea of deposing
	Satan? Talk, <em>mujik</em>, and tell the
	truth. All of it.”</p>

	<p>“Blame Broncov, not me,” Volonsky
	pleaded. “It was his scheme
	to kill off several thousand loyal
	party comrades. They got a choice:
	Be tortured to death, or die quickly
	and work for a revolution in Hell
	as soon as they arrived. <span class="keep_together">Naturally—”</span></p>

	<p>“I’ve heard enough, rat.” Nick
	spat contemptuously, and a puff
	of gray smoke spread rapidly over
	walls, ceiling and floor. “That will
	hold you,” he jeered, and opened
	the door. Aping the Minister’s important
	waddle, he walked over to
	the great press.</p>

	<p>Editor Blochensk stared with
	fear-bulged eyes. “Anything—anything
	wrong, Your Excellency comrade?”
	he asked shakily.</p>

	<p>“Nothing I can’t fix.”</p>

	<p>“Oh!” The editor clutched his
	throat. “Thank—uh—<span class="keep_together">uh—”</span></p>

	<p>“Never mind, I know Who you
	mean.” Muttering words in Hell’s
	silent language, Nick walked completely
	around the press. “It’s perfect,
	Blochy. Don’t let the content
	worry you. It’s part of The PLAN.
	Roll out your papers and deliver
	them fast. Don’t question anything.
	Orders from—you know.”</p>

	<p>Only minutes ahead of the new
	Volonsky, Cletus had entered the
	lobby of the Droshky Hotel on
	Red Square. The cherubic scout
	had obeyed orders and made himself
	bellhop size, large size. He
	didn’t exactly resemble the one in
	the cigarette ad but he had the
	kid’s twinkle in his dark eyes. And
	he had already latched onto a luscious
	blonde; or, more likely, Nick
	concluded, the reverse.</p>

	<p>Having just registered as a Persian
	prince, Cletus again clanked
	down a large sack of gold pieces
	and a smaller one of jewels. “Put
	these diamonds and rubies into
	your best safe,” he ordered in perfect
	Russian.</p>

	<p>The clerk’s eyes began popping,
	so did the blonde’s and those of
	a score of spectators, including four
	hard-faced MVD boys.</p>

	<p>“And I’ll take care of you,
	Honey-Navi,” the blonde said.</p>

	<p>“Ah, you just love me for my
	two billion dollars,” the imp retorted,
	and winked at her. As did
	Nick, Cletus could plainly see the
	twist operated on the MVD payroll
	as well as in her own interests.</p>

	<p>“I’m selling out my fifty oil
	wells,” he announced, “and I’ve
	come to town to see the head man,
	whoever he is today. I thought I’d
	let you dumb <em>mujiks</em> bid for the
	wells before I practically give them
	to Super-San Oil company for a
	measly two hundred million dollars.”</p>

	<p>“Of course, Prince Navi,” the
	clerk said loudly. He nodded toward
	<a class="pagenum" id="page123" title="123"> </a>the four tough lads who, likewise,
	had not yet noticed the great
	Volonsky.</p>

	<p>Nick rapped on the counter with
	his six-carat diamond ring. “How
	about a little service here, comrade?”</p>

	<p>“One moment, comrade,” the
	clerk said nervously.</p>

	<p>“What you mean, one moment?”
	Nick roared. “I haven’t flown all
	the way from New York to have a
	two-bit clerk tell me to wait. I represent
	Super-San Oil and I’m here
	to meet a Persian Prince Navi.”</p>

	<p>“Quiet, Amerikaner, till—Oh,
	Your Excellency Comrade Vychy
	Volonsky!” The mouth of the astonished
	clerk fell open. Then,
	fearful of making a wrong move
	in the Red game of dirty politics,
	he failed to guess why the great one
	should act as a miserable capitalist.
	“A thousand pardons, Your Excellency
	Comrade. What can I do for
	the beloved comrade? I didn’t recognize
	<span class="keep_together">you—”</span></p>

	<p>“Hush, fool!” Nick looked toward
	Cletus just then gazing into
	the blonde’s blue eyes.</p>

	<p>The four MVD agents went into
	a quick huddle, then the one with
	a broken nose bowed to the fake
	Volonsky. “If Your Excellency
	Comrade will step aside with us,
	we’ll explain this fool’s mistake.”</p>

	<p>“Put him in the can and question
	him tomorrow,” Nick snarled.
	“Anybody can see he’s working
	for the filthy capitalists.”</p>

	<p>“Of course, Your Excellency
	Comrade.” Broken nose and his
	three pals escorted Nick to a chair
	beside a column. “I’m Lieutenant
	Putov of the MVD,” he whispered.
	“We picked up this Prince
	Navi the instant he entered, and
	have been watching him.”</p>

	<p>“Skip the commercial,” Nick
	said, almost laughing as he gave
	Moloch’s favorite expression.
	“How come you didn’t spot him at
	one of our airports?”</p>

	<p>“He must have landed on an
	abandoned field in his private
	plane, Your Excellency Comrade.”
	Lieutenant Putov glanced at the
	other three equally worried looking
	plug-uglies. “He’s a prince, all
	right. Look at the gold and jewels
	he tossed to the clerk, several million
	dol—I mean, several billion
	rubles. We haven’t checked his
	story, but he claims he’s here to sell
	fifty Persian oil wells.”</p>

	<p>“I know <em>that</em>, idiot. Our spies
	in Baghdad advised us yesterday.
	That’s why I pretend to be with
	the stinking Super-<span class="keep_together">San—Wggh!”</span></p>

	<p>“What are Your Excellency
	Comrade’s wishes?”</p>

	<p>“Get him away from that blonde
	before she ruins our plans.”</p>

	<p>“Ah, that’s Nishka, one of us.”
	Astonishment widened Putov’s
	watery blue eyes. “Have you forgotten
	the night you and she
	<span class="keep_together">drank—”</span></p>

	<p>“You talk too much, Putov.”
	Nick flapped a hand. “Get a car
	to take me and the prince to the
	Kremlin. Hurry it! Comrade
	Andrei Broncov and I have a
	Council meeting at midnight. You
	<a class="pagenum" id="page124" title="124"> </a>three, bring the prince to me here.”</p>

	<p>Cletus and Nishka had withdrawn
	to a sofa in an alcove off
	the lobby. Without effort, Nick
	could see them and hear the female
	agent saying: “How do I know you
	have all that money, Navi-Honey?
	I’ll bet you brought gilt lead and
	fake jewels just to impress me.”</p>

	<p>“No, but I’ve been to America,”
	Cletus bragged, knowing well his
	boss would be listening. “So be
	nice and I’ll prove they’re real. I’ve
	been everywhere but this lousy
	place. I even lived in Egypt.”</p>

	<p>“Talk some Egyptian for me,”
	Nishka wheedled.</p>

	<p>“I’ve forgotten most of it,”
	Cletus said, cannily dodging the
	trap. “But I once made a study of
	the ancient language.” He ripped
	out a stream of what had once been
	his native tongue. Then, partly at
	least to test Nishka’s knowledge,
	he added in English, “How’s for
	looking at my room before we go
	out on the town?”</p>

	<p>“Wha-at? Why, you bad boy!”
	The girl winked at her three fellow
	agents coming toward them in a
	crablike walk, then spoke in Cletus’
	ear: “It’s the LAW, Navi-Honey,
	but don’t let them worry you. Little
	Nishka will stay with you—to the
	limit.”</p>

	<p>Cletus leered at her and rose to
	accompany the MVD to the front
	of the lobby. He and Nick put on
	an act, then went to the street followed
	by a chattering crowd.</p>

	<p>Once inside the sleek car Putov
	had conjured up, Nick said: “The
	heap is wired so we’ll talk only in
	Hell language.”</p>

	<h2 id="chapter_4">IV</h2>

	<p><span class="first_word">It wasn’t far</span> to the grim walls
	of the Kremlin, and as the big
	car purred across the snowy, radio-stricken
	square, Nick gave Cletus
	the main points of his plan. Obviously
	warned, the police gave a
	snappy salute and let the car enter
	the courtyard. A few moments later,
	Hell’s emissaries were zooming
	through long corridors and up to
	the second floor; walking the last
	fifty yards.</p>

	<p>Six husky guards armed with
	sub-machine guns opened the great
	doors to the Premier’s private
	study. “He’s been asking for you,”
	a huge guard whispered.</p>

	<p>“He would, the brainless pup,”
	Nick snarled, reading the big fellow’s
	thoughts. A Volonsky man
	called Gorkzy. “Don’t announce
	us.”</p>

	<p>Inside the great room, at a desk
	almost large enough for a roller
	skating rink, Andrei Broncov appeared
	to be studying a document.
	True executive, he went on reading
	till Nick coughed.</p>

	<p>“Your Excellency Comrade Broncov,
	I have brought Prince Navi.
	Where is the rest of the Council?”</p>

	<p>“Ah!” Broncov’s plump face
	widened in a smile for Cletus.
	“This is an honor, Your Highness.
	I trust you will pardon my preoccupation
	with affairs of state.
	They’re in a mess—as are all capitals
	<a class="pagenum" id="page125" title="125"> </a>when the old order departs. I
	supposed you’d be announced.”
	Andrei Broncov glared at the
	pseudo Volonsky and whispered in
	a dialect, “The Council is waiting
	below, fool.”</p>

	<p>“Nuts,” Cletus said. “Talk English,
	will you? I can hardly understand
	your outlandish language.
	Or, speak Persian.”</p>

	<p>“My knowledge of your native
	tongue is not good, but I’m quite
	at home in English or Amerikaner.
	A Russian <span class="keep_together">invented—”</span></p>

	<p>“Yeah, he knows,” Nick cut in.
	“Forget the malarkey, Bronco.
	This lad is here on business and
	has no time for our phoney hooptedo.
	From his grandfather, the old
	Shah, he inherited fifty of the
	richest oil wells in Asia, and he’s
	giving us a chance to bid on them
	instead of carrying on a, quote,
	cold, unquote, war, and <span class="keep_together">steal—”</span></p>

	<p>“I understand,” Broncov said
	through his big teeth. His lips
	tightened in his rage over Volonsky’s
	direct speech, but he managed
	to say fairly suavely: “Your Highness,
	we appreciate your giving us
	a chance to buy your wells. Surely,
	a banquet is in order.”</p>

	<p>“No, I want to get out of this
	place. It’s too cold.”</p>

	<p>Nick peered over his Volonsky
	nose-glasses. “How much, kid?
	No fooling.”</p>

	<p>“Volonsky!” Broncov barked.
	“Mind your speech. I’ll handle this
	little deal. You’re excused.”</p>

	<p>“Uh-uh.” Nick grinned. “I stay
	for <em>my</em> cut.”</p>

	<p>“You both look like a couple
	of crooks to me,” said the young
	prince. “I want two hundred million
	dollars—in gold.”</p>

	<p>Broncov’s hand shook as he
	reached for a row of buttons. “How
	about a bit of tea and cakes, or,
	perhaps something stronger before
	we discuss this matter with the
	Council? They’re waiting just below
	us, and I’d like to present the
	deal already consummated.”</p>

	<p>“Got any Old Style Lager
	around?” Cletus asked.</p>

	<p>“We have some good Bavarian
	beer, a stock we—ah—bought some
	time ago.”</p>

	<p>“I’ve heard how much you paid
	the Heinies. The beer I want is
	made in Wisconsin, USA, so I
	think I’ll fly over there tonight.
	Super-San Oil keeps begging me
	to visit their country. Offered me
	two hundred million for my wells
	but only half in gold. I want all
	gold, and I won’t discuss any other
	terms.”</p>

	<p>“Bungler!” Broncov whispered
	in dialect. “Why didn’t you get
	him drunk, first? Without oil we
	can’t carry on this cold war or kid
	the peasants much longer. Where
	in hell could we get even two
	hundred dollars in gold?”</p>

	<p>“Go to hell and find all you
	want,” Nick said with a wicked
	grin.</p>

	<p>“I understood what you high-binders
	said,” Cletus put in. “My
	cousin told me before I left home
	Communist clucks don’t savvy
	Saturday from Sunday. Everybody
	<a class="pagenum" id="page126" title="126"> </a>knows you top boys have stolen
	everything not nailed down, and
	have stashed it away against the
	time your own people kick out
	Communism for good.”</p>

	<p>“Oh, come, Prince Navi, I don’t
	understand how such an evil story
	started. Our people wouldn’t
	<span class="keep_together">dare—”</span></p>

	<p>“Wouldn’t they?” Cletus laughed
	nastily. “We have spies too,
	and we know your common herd
	would settle for anything else. Most
	of them want their church and their
	Tsar back, bad as he was.”</p>

	<p>“Bah! The capitalist press started
	that myth.”</p>

	<p>“Why, Bronco,” Nick protested,
	“you can read that story in Pravda,
	‘The Organ of Truth.’” The fake
	Minister of Culture cleared his
	throat to keep from laughing when
	the glowering Premier began thinking
	of various ways to torture unsympathetic
	comrades. In silent
	Hell language, Nick added: “Good
	work, Cleet. I’ll take it from here.”</p>

	<p>“Lies put out by the war mongerers
	of Wall Street,” Broncov shouted.
	He continued raving, but Nick
	no longer listened.</p>

	<p>Sounds outside the window told
	him time had begun pressing. He
	shook the hat he’d been carrying.
	“Gold, is it you want, Prince Navi?
	You think we have none? How
	about this?”</p>

	<p>A glittering gold piece tinkled
	on the floor and rolled toward the
	amazed Red Premier. Puffing, he
	bent over and scooped up a newly
	minted coin the size of the American
	gold eagle. “It’s a new issue—I—never
	mind. We have lots more
	where this came from, haven’t we,
	comrade Vychy?”</p>

	<p>“I’ll say,” Nick said. “Watch!”</p>

	<p>Gold pieces continued falling
	from the hat, one by one, then in
	a steady stream. Stunned, Broncov
	clutched his throat, muttering: “It
	can’t be true. Miracles don’t happen.”</p>

	<p>He watched in silence while his
	Minister of Culture made a pile of
	gold coins four feet high. When
	the floor timbers began creaking,
	Nick made another similar heap;
	then, others, till the thick walls
	began bulging inward.</p>

	<p>“Stop!” Broncov cried. “A couple
	of tons is enough.” Eyes now
	popping, he waved his arms as the
	floor sagged under fifty times that
	weight. “There’s the two hundred
	million for you, Prince. The rest is
	for—us. We’ll sign the papers in
	another room.”</p>

	<p>Ignoring frightened cries, Nick
	made more piles of gold next to
	the windows. Outside on Red
	Square, people were running in all
	directions, shouting and waving
	newspapers. A cannon roared. A
	hundred or more machine guns
	began rattling. Plainly, the bullets
	were not fired at any one, for the
	people were laughing and weeping,
	singing and dancing.</p>

	<p>“Come here and have a look,
	Bronco,” Nick suggested.</p>

	<p>“It’s—a trick, a revolution,”
	Broncov panted. “Damn you, Volonsky,
	you started it.” He snatched
	<a class="pagenum" id="page127" title="127"> </a>a heavy revolver from his desk and
	fired it at Nick without warning.</p>

	<p>The false Volonsky laughed
	when five of the slugs bounced off
	the invisible shield around him. A
	sixth bullet splintered the window
	glass. The other five returned and
	struck the raging Red boss, cutting
	his face and arms enough to bring
	streams of blood. He dashed for
	the door but collided with the six
	guards who burst into the room.</p>

	<p>Broncov wiped off some of the
	blood running into his eyes well
	enough to see all six waving copies
	of Pravda. “What’s going on
	here?” he screamed.</p>

	<p>“Read about it in Pravda,” bellowed
	Gorkzy, the huge guard. “It
	always prints the truth—you’ve
	taught us.”</p>

	<p>“What truth?” quavered the
	Premier. “Put down those guns!”</p>

	<p>“Oh, no. Pravda says you were
	shot trying to escape, and for once
	it really told the truth.” Implacably,
	the big guard brought up his
	Tommy-gun and let it rattle.</p>

	<p>The stricken Red leader took two
	steps backward and fell to the floor
	as the other five guns opened up
	on him in a hell’s chatter of death.
	His falling weight added the last
	straw to the overstrained floor timbers.
	They gave way in a roar, and
	a hundred tons of yellow gold
	streamed downward in a cataclysmic
	wave of wealth and death to the
	Council members below.</p>

	<hr class="thoughtbreak" />


	<p class="post_thoughtbreak">Poised on air, Nick and Cletus
	became invisible to mortal eyes.
	“That wraps it, Cleet. Let’s see
	how the boys take it.”</p>

	<p>The six guards were peering
	down into the ruin below, and at
	some of the fortune still clinging
	to the slanting floor.</p>

	<p>“Great Nicholas!” Gorkzy yelled.
	“Gold!”</p>

	<p>“Just like Pravda says,” howled
	another man. “Listen! It says:
	‘Volonsky and the mysterious Persian
	prince have disappeared. Broncov
	executed by heroic guards. All
	members of the once-feared Inner
	Council crushed almost beyond
	recognition when floor crashed upon
	them from the weight of the
	gold brought by the prince.’”</p>

	<p>“And look at this!” roared the
	big Gorkzy. “‘All soldiers and police
	throw down their arms. Refuse
	to shoot the people shouting they
	want their Tsar and church back.
	Satellite countries freed of the
	odious Communist yoke. Concentration
	camps, collective farming,
	and slave labor abolished. All spies
	and saboteurs recalled to Moscow
	for trial and punishment. Ivan, the
	Tsar, to issue proclamation.’”</p>

	<p>“What Tsar?” The six stared
	stupidly at one another.</p>

	<p>One man picked up a shiny gold
	piece and tested it with his teeth.
	“The Bolsheviks murdered the old
	goat and all his family. How can
	this be?”</p>

	<p>“He probably left plenty of bastards,”
	another man hazarded.</p>

	<p>“I get it,” Gorkzy shouted.
	“Prince Navi is a grandson. His
	name is N-a-v-i—Ivan spelled
	<a class="pagenum" id="page128" title="128"> </a>backward. Why, the smart little
	devil! And now he’s here some
	place to reign over us.”</p>

	<p>“Oh, no,” Cletus protested as he
	and Nick slithered through the
	wall. “You aren’t going to make
	me rule over these dopes, boss.
	Have a heart. It’s cold here, and
	the whole country stinks.”</p>

	<p>“That’s your punishment, m’lad,
	for letting Raphael and Michael
	catch onto you. You can’t prowl
	around Heaven just now so you’ll
	have to work here in Hell’s Rear
	Annex for a while. Look!” Nick
	thumbed one of the gold pieces.
	“Your image stamped on all of
	them. Also ‘Ivan—Tsar. In God
	We Trust.’”</p>

	<p>“Okay,” Cletus said, shuffling a
	little, then brightening. “Anyhow,
	I’ll have Nishka.”</p>

	<p>“Not if the common folks find
	out she worked for the MVD.”
	As if to punctuate Nick’s prophesy,
	a dozen bombs exploded inside
	police headquarters.</p>

	<p>“Heck!” Cletus shrugged resignedly.
	“Well, lend me that hat,
	and conjure up a couple million
	tons of soap—not perfumed.”</p>

	<p>Roaring with laughter, Nick
	promised to spread soap over the
	entire country, then watched the
	little imp zooming back and forth
	across Red Square—sprinkling the
	snowy pavement with Ivan-Tsar
	pieces of gold.</p>

	<hr class="thoughtbreak" />


	<p class="post_thoughtbreak">The Satanic laughter lasted till
	Nick had whizzed half way across
	Chaos. “That caper,” he told himself
	gleefully, “will fool The BBU
	about my plan. Or, will it? Great
	Hades! I did a <em>good</em> deed.”</p>

	<p>A million miles above the wastes
	of Chaos, he remembered he still
	wore Volonsky whose shade would
	still be imprisoned in the Pravda
	room. Nick shucked out of his unpleasant
	quarters, halted to watch
	the thing spinning downward.</p>

	<p>“Cheer up, Vych,” he laughed.
	“Next century I’ll gather up what’s
	left and give it back to you—maybe.”</p>
